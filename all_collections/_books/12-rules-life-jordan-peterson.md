This book explores various topics about human psychology  from evolution to contemporary times.
## Notes
Currently reading on Rule 3. 

## *RULE 1: Stand up straight with your shoulders back*

If a dominant lobster is badly defeated, its brain basically dissolves. Then it grows a new, subordinate’s brain—one more appropriate to its new, lowly position.
* That same brutal principle of unequal distribution applies outside the financial domain—indeed, anywhere that creative production is required.
* It is exponentially more worthwhile to be successful, if you are a lobster, and male.

Evolution works through variation and natural selection.  

 The part of our brain that keeps track of our position in the dominance hierarchy is therefore exceptionally ancient and fundamental. 
This is why, when we are defeated, we act very much like lobsters who have lost a fight.

 Low serotonin -> decreased confidence. 

Money will make you liable to the dangerous temptations of drugs and alcohol, which are much more rewarding if you have been deprived of pleasure for a long period.

Little worth, the counter restricts serotonin availability. _You become reactive to any circumstance or event that might produce emotion._

It will even shut down your immune system, expending the energy and resources required for future health now, during the crises of the present. It makes you impulsive,For eg, at any short-term mating opportunities, or any possibilities of pleasure.
{: .notice--danger }

You can delay gratification, without forgoing it forever.  
Erratic habits of sleeping and eating can interfere with its function.
{:.notice}

It is for this reason that routine is so necessary. The acts of life we repeat every day need to be automatized. 
{:.notice}

Go to bed at the same time each evening, but waking up at a consistent hour is a necessity.

Anxiety was reduced to subclinical levels merely because they started to sleep on a predictable schedule and eat breakfast.

A hangover is alcohol withdrawal (which quite frequently kills withdrawing alcoholics), and it starts all too soon after drinking ceases.

If you say no, early in the cycle of oppression, and you mean what you say (which means you state your refusal in no uncertain terms and stand behind it) then the scope for oppression on the part of oppressor will remain properly bounded and limited.
{: .notice--warning}

Honestly—even if you were unpopular or bullied at home or in grade school—it’s not necessarily appropriate now. Circumstances change. 

Emotion is partly bodily expression, and can be amplified (or dampened) by that expression.

Attend carefully to your posture. Quit drooping and hunching around

## RULE 2: Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping


**Order is tribe, religion, hearth, home and country.**

You’re in order, when you have a loyal friend, a trustworthy ally.

When the same person betrays you, sells you out, you move from the daytime world of clarity and light to the dark underworld of chaos, confusion and despair.
{: .notice--primary }

**Chaos is the experience of reeling unbound and unsupported through space when your guiding routines and traditions collapse.**

Friendly old dogs can still bite. Old and trusted friends can still deceive. 

This means that the most significant elements of our environment of origin were personalities, not things, objects or situations.

This means that male and female and parent and child are categories, for us—natural categories.
{: .notice--info}

Reality itself is whatever we contend with when we are striving to survive and reproduce. A lot of that is other beings, their opinions of us, and their communities. And that’s that.

And “outside” is not merely unexplored physical territory. Outside is outside of what we currently understand—and understanding is dealing with and coping with and not merely representing objectively. 

* Our minds are far older than mere humanity. 

* Our categories are far older than our species.

This is perhaps because the primary hierarchical structure of human society is masculine, as it is among most animals, including the chimpanzees who are our closest genetic.

**Order is God the Father.**

It’s credit cards, classrooms, supermarket checkout lineups, turn-taking, traffic lights, and the familiar routes of daily commuters

Order, when pushed too far, when imbalanced, can also manifest itself destructively and terribly. It does so as the forced migration, the concentration camp,

Chaos is mater, origin, source, mother; materia, the substance from which all things are made

In its positive guise, chaos is possibility itself,

Most men do not meet female human standards.

It is Woman as Nature who looks at half of all men and says, “No!” For the men, that’s a direct encounter with chaos.

Women’s proclivity to say no, more than any other force, has shaped our evolution into the creative, industrious, upright, large-brained (competitive, aggressive, domineering) creatures that we are.
{: .notice--danger}

No matter where we are, there are some things we can identify, make use of, and predict, and some things we neither know nor understand. 

Thus, you need to place one foot in what you have mastered and understood and the other in what you are currently exploring and mastering. Then the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.

But the capacity of women to shame men and render them self-conscious is still a primal force of nature. 
{: .notice}

Naked means unprotected and unarmed in the jungle of nature and man. This is why Adam and Eve became ashamed, immediately after their eyes were opened.

Beauty shames the ugly. Strength shames the weak. Death shames the living—and the Ideal shames us all. Thus we fear it, resent it—even hate it.
{: .notice--information}

This all means that women pay a high price for pregnancy and child-rearing, particularly in the early stages, and that one of the inevitable consequences is increased dependence upon the sometimes unreliable and always problematic good graces of men.

To do that, you will have to eternally sacrifice the present for the future

you will have to work. And it’s going to be difficult. I hope you’re fond of thorns and thistles, because you’re going to grow a lot of them.”

That is as good a definition as any of self-consciousness. We are aware of our own defencelessness, finitude and mortality

Human beings have a great capacity for wrongdoing. Given that terrible capacity, that proclivity for malevolent actions, is it any wonder we have a hard time taking care of ourselves, or others—or even that we doubt the value of the entire human enterprise

And no one understands the darkness of the individual better than the individual himself. Who, then, when ill, is going to be fully committed to his own care.
