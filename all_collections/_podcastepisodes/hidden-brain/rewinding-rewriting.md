we all go back to past, to see what could have been done.
Laura went with her husband to skying. Unfortunately, her husband died as an avalanche fell down.
>she told that her husband had a bad feeling about that day earlier.

our mind keeps replaying those memories.
our mind changes narrative to have other ending.
{: .notice}
It's called counter factual.( mental simulation).
you seek alternate ending.

## Triggers for counter factual thinking..
1. seeing something negative.
2. something unordinary like he said its a bad day
3. you see how you played a central role..

## Why counterfactual are useful

1) counterfactual provide a set options which we might select in future.  
2) It gives a sense of control that they can
understand the world more. so, we turn bad things into lessons.

Sometimes, counterfactual show up when they are not useful and  
sometimes they don't appear.  
Sometimes, its a mirage and you wouldn't take that path.
