Communication skills is one of the most important factor how others perceive you. It is difficult to continue conversation if you don&#8217;t know how to ask the right question to others. As a solution, I built a software using Autohotkey which has all the interesting questions that you can ask other people.
  
It really useful while talking to your new online friends or when you get are out of conversation ideas.
