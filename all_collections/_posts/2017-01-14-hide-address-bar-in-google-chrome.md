This post is for you, if you get anxious when people look over your shoulder while you&#8217;re on the computer. Sometimes, you have 100 tabs open and don&#8217;t want to scare your classmates 😐
  
This reminds me of the comic about phone privacy.

This Autothotkey script hides your address bar by overlaying a fake address bar. It shows the original address bar when the cursor is near the address bar.
  
Here is the demo.

Download the Fake Address bar `<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1nsp1r3rnzt/Autohotkey-scripts/master/Autohotkey-scripts/fake.png" target="_blank">here</a>`
  
Save it into `D:/fake.png` or change the location in  `line 29` if you save it in another position.
