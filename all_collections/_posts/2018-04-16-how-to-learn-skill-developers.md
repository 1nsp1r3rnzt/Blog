&#8220;Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects&#8221; is a crucial course(most popular MOOC) which teaches you the effective techniques of the process of learning.


![learning how to learn banner image](/assets/images/uploads//2018/04/Introducing.png){: .full}

This course is taught by [Dr. Barbara Oakley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Oakley) and [Dr. Terrence Sejnowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Sejnowski)  on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/).


<div class="notice--info">
<h1> Lessons from week1</h1>

</div>

Dr. Oakley starts with explaining how the brain works. All of our thoughts, fears are in neurons.

There are two different modes of thinking.
<!-- more -->



## Focused Mode of Thinking

For repeating thoughts, We use focused mode of thinking to solve the problem. 
As below, highlighted path represents an existing thought pattern followed to solve a problem.

## Diffused Mode of Thinking

It is the relaxed mode of thinking while taking shower, while running or while exercising. Diffused mode helps with conceptual understanding.  ![Diffused Mode](/assets/images/uploads//2018/01/thinking-2.gif)

  * <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Abstract ideas like programming need more practice</span> to bring them into reality.
  * Even if the idea is abstract, the neural networks are real and concrete if you strengthen them.

### Tips From Week 1:

Solving problem creates new neural networks while looking for an answer does not.

<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Don't look for a solution without trying to solve the problem</strong>:</span>


### Procrastination, Memory, and Sleep


Memory is of two types.
1. working memory
2. Long-term memory.

#### Working memory:

It is like a blackboard and holds about 4 chunks of information.

> Its the reason, You need to repeat information like remembering phone numbers.

#### Long-Term Memory

It is like a storage warehouse having room for billions of items.

Spaced repetition methods help to process information from working memory to long-term memory.

Use flashcards. when mind relates pattern, it put pieces together. ([Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a freemium available on the major platform for SRS)

#### The Importance of sleep

![sleep importance](/assets/images/uploads//2018/04/angel-1891440_640.jpg)

Sleep is vital for effective learning. Being awake creates a toxic production in the brain. So, having a quality sleep tidy up learning ideas.


### Interviews from week 1

Creativity comes with creative people. _Isolated genius is no better these days._

# WEEK 2: What is a chunk
{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--success">{{ notice-3 | markdownify }}</div>

A Chunk is a network of neurons that unite scattered bit of information through meaning.

Focusing your attention is an important part of learning.

You can't make connections when you are angry.

**create conceptual chunks:**

For example, Pop[sound]

  * is easier to remember
  * has a symphony of neurons underlying.

### **How to form** chunk?

For example, if you want to learn how to hold a guitar.

_watch someone else. Learn the pattern._

Learn small chunks. They get joined.

### **What is the Best chunk?**

You don't need to think about connecting neuron networks. Learning is a bit by bit process.


### Illusions of competence.

<div class="notice">
  <p>It's that moment when you believe that you know the answers but fail during the real test. It's the illusion of knowledge.</p>

</div>

  * The solution is to self-test using tests and quizzes.
  * The recall is better than book reading.
  * **Reading is only needed when there is a gap between revision.**
  * Recalling outside your zone of study provides subliminal clues
  * When you recall at different positions, it makes you independent of locations.

### Seeing the bigger picture (What motivates you)

Motivation is controlled by dopamine which is controlled by __reward learning.__

It releases dopamine when we have unexpected rewards.

<span style="color: #333300;">Lastly, Chunks get fade</span> if not practiced.

### **Problem Solving Process**

The sequential process of problem-solving is different from the intuitive process.

![problem solving](/assets/images/uploads/2018/03/problemsolving.png)

Both problem-solving methods are crucial and required to tackle new challenges.

#### Law of serendipity

Law of Serendipity says that <em>Lady Luck favors the one who tries</em>

  1. Focus on the thing that you are studying.
  2. Once you put the first problem or concept into your mental library, The next concept will go in more easily.


Overlearning: Studying again and again in the same session is not useful. Deliberate practice should be done 
{: .notice--success}

#### **Einstellung**

It refers to a man's inclination to solve a given problem in a particular way despite the fact that better or more fitting strategies for solving the issue exist.

  * **Unlearn older ideas, Intuition can be wrong.**

### Tips from Interviews

Norman Fortenberry provides several tips.

  * Team up with others.
  * It's important to take breaks.( it involves mental turnoff)
  * <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exercise helps to create neural networks</span>.
  * Explain to others. (Either validate your thoughts or find [fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies))
  * Be Motivated. Have a mission.
  * Make concrete projects

<h1> Week 3: Procrastination and Memory</h1>

</div>

  

### Tackling procrastination

It takes a lot of willpower to do the tasks which you need to do.

![procrastination](/assets/images/uploads//2018/04/procrastination-1.jpg)

The process of procrastination starts when your brain feels that task at hand is difficult.

1. You feel unhappy.
2. You funnel attention to a present task.
3. you are happy temporarily.
4. You devise irrational excuses and procrastinate.

#### The secret of building new habits.

Creating new habits is 4 step process.

1. <span style="color: #993300;">cue</span>.  The ways to minimize it is to minimize distractions.
  * quiet spot in the library.
  * Leave phone aside.
2. <span style="color: #993300;">Routine:</span> Which means to develop a plan
3. <span style="color: #993300;">The Reward</span>: Have exciting and interesting rewards like read your favorite website. Setting the reward at a particular time means mini-deadline.
4. <span style="color: #993300;"> The belief</span>: Habits have power because you have belief in them. To change habits, you need to change the underlying belief. Believe that your new system will work.   Hangout with classmates with a can-do-attitude.

  

### **process vs product**

Focus on the process rather than the product or final outcome to become an efficient learner.
  
  

#### Learning new subject.

Realize that you will have a negative feeling at the start.
  * Use Pomodoro Technique to focus.
  * When distraction arises let it flow.
    * Use Noise-canceling headphones
    * study in a quiet environment

  
**Focus on the process**: The flow of time

The process relates to simple habits. On the other hand, focusing on the product triggers the Pain.
  
#### Other Tips to tackle procrastination:

1.  Developing an encouraging culture with like-minded friends can help to remember values.
2.  A weekly list of key tasks in a planner journal. (List of tasks you can reasonably work on.)
3.  Daily to-do list(check before sleep)
4.  Mix other tasks with learning. It helps to avoid prolonged sitting. You will improve quickly.
5.  Plan your quitting time. Try to squeeze a break time.
6.  Commit yourself to a routine and a task. Deliberately delay rewards until you finish.
7.  Watch for procrastination cues.
8.  Try putting yourself in a new environment. For example, the library.
9.  Gain trust on your new system.

</div>

### Exercise
  
*   It helps new neuron to survive. Also, it helps all vital organs.
*   Far more effective than any other method.
  
#### Practice:
Learning does not progress logically so each day adds an additional knowledge.

when you hit a wall, it indicates that your mind is restructuring.

It takes time to assimilate knowledge.

### Make visual metaphor or analogy
  
Metaphors and models help in the physical understanding of the central idea. 
{: .notice--danger}
  
 Metaphors also help glue an idea into your mind.

Make a connection to neurons.

stories help to retain information easily.

### No need for genius envy

Everybody has different gifts and talents.

Imposter syndrome is like a tape which plays in your head. It's very common.

#### Change your thoughts

  * Take responsibility for your own learning.

  * Empathy is not always beneficial.

  * Greater the achievement, more people gonna attack you.

  * Take pride in who you are, use as a secret talisman for success.

Not only Nobel Prize winners but most people face critics at all stages of life.

[The interesting story of Santiago Ramon](http://www.metalearn.net/articles/learn-like-santiago-ramon-y-cajal) who achieved success after being a petty criminal in young age.

You define your limits not other people and defy the prejudices from other about, what you can achieve.

#### Unlocking your potential

##### The value of teamwork

Avoid blind spots and errors by brainstorming and working with others who are also smartly focused on the topic.
Working in a team->useful for career-> can unfold new ways.

Warning: Groups studies are useful only if socialization talk is minimum.

##### Testing checklist:

The test is a mini recall of what you have learned so far.

Its wonderful way of concentrating the mind.

Dr. Barbara Oakley [provides a series of questions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/D40pr/a-test-checklist) to determine if you are doing the test in a correct way.

##### Hard Start: Jump to Easy

During an exam, start with the hardest problems but quickly jump (~ 2 minutes) to the easy ones.

It allows the diffused mode to work and allows to reach for a solution for hardest problem efficiently.

Final Words:
------------

Remind yourself, how to do it, go ahead and push on. Finally, You have not truly learned until you can teach it to others.

This course provided some eye-opening insights into the complex working of the brain and hopefully will help to understand the process of learning better. Please share, if you find this review useful.
